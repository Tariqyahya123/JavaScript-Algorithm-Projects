# JavaScript-Algorithm-Projects
A collection of JavaScript algoritm projects, that do specific tasks.

## PALINDROME CHECKER:

ReturnS true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## ROMAN NUMERAL CONVERTER:

Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

## ROT-13 DECODER:

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

## TELEPHONE NUMBER VALIDATOR:

Returns true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

## CASH REGISTER SYSTEM:

A cash register drawer system that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

Returns {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Returns {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, returns {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.
